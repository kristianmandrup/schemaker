# Model configuration
# Has responsibiloity to configure relationships between all models
# A single behavior decoration can have up to three acting models in a joined relationship

# The subject model: 
# - is the model which is the subject of the behavior added.
# - it has the main field, which CAN be a relationship to the object model, either directly or via a join model (fx in Relational DBs)
# 
# The object model: 
# - is the object of interest to the subject, fx a Role model is the object of interest for a UserAccount (subject)
# - the object can be referenced directly, via a join model or embedded under the subject
#
# The join model: 
# - is used to bind object to subject in a Many-to-Many relationship, typically for Relational DBs
# - it must have a foreign key for both object and subject model, and most often no primary key of its own
